<H2> Ingredients</H2>
<ul>
    <li>1⅛ lbs Ground Beef</li>
    <li>¾ lb Whole Wheat Spaghetti Pasta</li>
    <li>1 28-Ounce Can Tomato Purée</li>
    <li>½ cup Panko Breadcrumbs</li>
    <li> 5 oz Arugula</li>
        <li> 2 Carrots</li>
  <li>  1 Tangelo</li>
    <li> 1 Yellow Onion</li>
        <li>1 large bunch Parsley</li>
            <li> 1 Tbsp Meatball Spice Blend (Whole Fennel Seeds, Dried Oregano, Dried Thyme, Garlic Powder, Ground Coriander & Smoked Paprika)</li>
                <li> ½ cup Grated Parmesan Cheese</li>
                    <li>  ¼ cup Sliced Almonds</li></ul>
   <p>
    <h2>Prepare the ingredients:</h2>
    Wash and dry the fresh produce. Heat a large pot of salted water to boiling on high.<br>
     Peel and small dice the carrots. Peel and medium dice the tangelo; remove the seeds. <br>
     Peel and small dice the onion. Pick the parsley leaves off the stems; discard the stems and <br>
    roughly chop half the leaves, keeping the remaining leaves whole.
   </p>

   <p>
    <h2>Cook the aromatics:</h2>
    In a medium pan (nonstick, if you have one), heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil on medium until hot.<br>
    Add half the carrots and half the onion; season with salt. Cook, stirring occasionally,<br>
    2 to 3 minutes, or until softened. Add the spice blend.<br>
    Cook, stirring frequently, 2 to 3 minutes, or until fragrant.<br> 
    Transfer the cooked aromatics to a plate and spread into a thin layer to cool.<br> 
    Wipe out the pan.<br>
   </p>

   <p>
    <h2>Make the sauce:</h2>
    While the aromatics cool, in a large pot, heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil on medium until hot. <br>
    Add the remaining carrots and onion; season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally,<br>
    3 to 4 minutes, or until softened. Add the tomato purée and 1 cup of water; season with salt and pepper.<br>
    Heat to boiling on high. Once boiling, reduce the heat to low. Simmer, stirring occasionally, 6 to 8 minutes, <br>
    or until the liquid is slightly reduced in volume.<br>
    Remove from heat. Set aside in a warm place.
   </p>

   <p>
    <h2>Make the meatballs & add them to the sauce:</h2>
    While the sauce simmers and once the aromatics are cool enough to handle, in a large bowl,<br>
    combine the ground beef, breadcrumbs, chopped parsley, cooked aromatics and half the Parmesan cheese; <br>
    season with salt. Using your hands, form the mixture into 19 to 21 meatballs (each about the size of a golf ball). <br>
    In the pan used to cook the aromatics, heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil on medium until hot. Add the meatballs in a <br>
    single layer and cook, stirring occasionally, 8 to 10 minutes, or until evenly browned; transfer to the pot of sauce. <br>
    Simmer the meatballs and sauce on low, stirring occasionally, 4 to 6 minutes, or until the meatballs are cooked through. <br>
    Remove from heat. Set aside in a warm place.<br>
   </p>

   <p>
        <h2>Cook the pasta:</h2>
        While the meatballs and sauce simmer, add the pasta to the pot of boiling water. <br>
        Cook, stirring frequently, 9 to 11 minutes, or until al dente (still slightly firm to the bite). <br>
        Drain the pasta thoroughly and return to the pot. Drizzle with olive oil and toss to coat. <br>
        Set aside in a warm place.<br>
   </p>
<p>
    <h2>Make the salad & serve your dish:</h2>
    In a large bowl, combine the arugula, tangelo, almonds and half the remaining Parmesan cheese. <br>
    Drizzle with olive oil and toss to coat; season with salt and pepper to taste. <br>
    Transfer the salad to a serving dish. Transfer the cooked pasta to a separate serving dish; <br>
    spoon the meatballs and sauce over the pasta. Garnish with the whole parsley leaves and remaining Parmesan cheese. <br>
    Enjoy!
