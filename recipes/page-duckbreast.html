<H2>Ingredients</H2>
<p>
    <ul class="ingredients">
        <li>2 Skin-On Duck Breasts</li>
        <li>¾ lb Golden Potatoes</li>
        <li>2 ears Of Corn</li>
        <li>3 oz Baby Spinach</li>
        <li>1 bunch Parsley</li>
        <li>⅓ cup Chicken Bone Broth</li>  
        <li>1 Tbsp Red Wine Vinegar</li>          
        <li>2 Tbsps Butter</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp Dijon Mustard</li>
        <li>1 Shallot</li>
        <li>2 Tbsps Crème Fraîche</li>
        <li>½ oz Sweet Piquante Peppers</li>
            </ul>
        
<p>
  <H3>Cook & smash the potatoes</H3>
</p>
  <p>  Fill a medium pot 3/4 of the way up with salted water; cover and heat to boiling on high. <br>
    Wash and dry the fresh produce. If necessary, halve any potatoes larger than 2-inches in diameter.<br> 
    Once boiling, add the potatoes to the pot and cook 16 to 18 minutes, or until tender when pierced with a fork.<br> 
    Drain thoroughly and transfer to a sheet pan (or work surface). When cool enough to handle, using the flat side <br>
    of your knife (or the bottom of a small pan), carefully smash each cooked potato once to flatten.<br>
  </p>
<p>
<h3>Cook the duck</h3>

Meanwhile, pat the duck dry with paper towels.<br>
Season with salt and pepper on both sides. <br>
Heat a medium pan (nonstick, if you have one), <br>
on medium until hot. Add the seasoned duck, <br>
skin side down, and cook 9 to 11 minutes, or <br>
until browned and the skin is crispy. Flip and <br>
cook 4 to 5 minutes for medium (145°F), or until <br>
cooked to your desired degree of doneness.* <br>
Transfer to a cutting board, skin side up, and <br>
let rest at least 10 minutes. Carefully drain the <br>
duck fat into a small bowl. <br>
Wipe out the pan.<br>
</p>

<p>
  <H3>Prepare the remaining ingredients's</H3>

  Meanwhile, remove the husks and silks from the corn;<br> 
  cut the kernels off the cobs. <br>
  Peel and thinly slice the shallot. <br>
  Roughly chop the peppers. <br>
  Roughly chop the parsley leaves and stems.<br>
</p>
<p>
  <h3>Crisp the Potatoes</h3>
  In the same pan, heat 1 tablespoon of the reserved duck fat on medium-high until hot. <br>
  Add the smashed potatoes. Cook 1 to 2 minutes per side (if the pan seems dry, add the <br>
  remaining duck fat before flipping), or until browned and crispy. Transfer to a plate <br>
  and immediately season with salt and pepper. <br>
  Cover with foil to keep warm. Wipe out the pan.<br>
</p>
<p>
  <h3>Cook & finish the vegetables</h3>
  In the same pan, heat 2 teaspoons of olive oil on medium-high until hot. Add the corn kernels and sliced shallot; <br>
  season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, 1 to 2 minutes, or until slightly softened <br>
  (be careful, as the corn may pop as it cooks). Add the spinach. Cook, stirring frequently, 1 2 minutes, until wilted. <br>
  Transfer to a bowl; add the crème fraîche and chopped peppers. Season with salt and pepper; stir to combine. <br>
  Wipe out the pan.<br>
</p>
<p>
  <h3>Make the pan sauce & serve your dish</h3>
  In the same pan, heat the broth to boiling on high. Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium-high. <br>
  Add the butter, vinegar, and mustard. Cook, whisking constantly, 1 to 2 minutes, or until the sauce is thickened. <br>
  Turn off the heat. Taste, then season with salt and pepper if desired. <br>
  Flip the rested duck to be skin side down on the cutting board (to easily cut through the skin). <br>
  Thinly slice crosswise. Serve the sliced duck (skin side up) with the crisped potatoes and <br>
  finished vegetables on the side. Top the duck with the pan sauce.  <br>
  Garnish the vegetables with the chopped parsley. Enjoy!<br>
