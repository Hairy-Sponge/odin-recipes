Ingredients, curtesy of wikihow.
<ul>
    <li>1 bulb of black garlic, peeled</li>
    <li>½ cup (120 mL) of mayonnaise</li>
    <li>1 lb (450 g) of ground beef (if frozen, be sure to defrost first)</li>
    <li>1 ball of fresh mozzarella cheese, sliced</li>
    <li>4 hamburger buns</li>
    <li>1 bag of baby spinach</li>
    <li>Salt and pepper</li>
    <li>Sriracha</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
   <h2> Make the black garlic⁠–Sriracha mayo.</H2>
Puree the black garlic using a food processor.<br>
Mix in the mayonnaise plus 1 tsp (6 g) of salt. You can add more salt if needed.
Add in the Sriracha.<br>The black garlic has a very earthy taste, 
so the mayo will have a strong umami flavour.<br>
Squirting in some Sriracha will balance it out with some heat.
</p>
<p>
    <H2>BEAT YOUR MEAT</H2>
    Form 4 beef patties of equal size. Season both sides with salt and pepper.
</p>
<p>
    <h2>COOK YOUR MEAT</h2>
    Throw that ish on the grill, in the pan, on a cookie sheet and throw it in your car during the summer.<br>
    I don't care how ya do it, but cook it till it's at 160 degrees internally, and cooked thorough.<br>
</p>
<p>
    <h2>WHO CUT THE CHEESE</h2>
    Add slices of the mozzarella to the patties. cover with foil loosely if cooking on the stove. <br>
    i'm sure you've cooked burgers on the grill before.
</p>
<p>
    <h2>Build the burgers.</h2>
     Follow this order: bottom bun, a handful of baby spinach,<br> patty with melted cheese, a smear of black garlic⁠–Sriracha mayo, and top bun.
